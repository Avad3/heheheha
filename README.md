# Offline/untraceable bookmarklets 
These bookmarklet and exploits can be downloaded as a .html file and ran. This has the advantage of avoiding the prying eyes of teachers as when downloaded and ran, your teachers can't see the file you're running. <p>

  An IFrame loader to load Proxy sites your teacher can't see <p>
    A History flooder <p>
      An inspect element clone known as Eruda <p>
        An ad blocking bookmarklet <p>
          A snake game <p>
            A Tab cloak, you can use this as a bookmarklet, you won't need it for this ;) <p>
